// Mock Config (Replace with real one if needed, but for now assuming env vars or hardcoded checks if simpler)
// Actually, I can just use the existing firebase lib if I run this in context, but unrelated node script needs direct config.
// I will try to read from the app's config file or just use a simple reader if I can view the file.
// Wait, I can't easily run a node script with local firebase auth/config if not set up.
// Better approach: Modify `startQuiz` to LOG extensive details about the query and the results to the browser console,
// and ask the user to check console? No, user is non-technical.

// Better Plan: Add a visible "Debug Info" section to the UI temporarily or just use the Admin dashboard to "View Questions".
// Let's check `app/admin/page.tsx` or similar. I don't have a "View Questions" page.
// I will create a simple "Data Inspector" in `app/admin/debug/page.tsx`.

const config = require('../lib/firebase-config-manual'); // I don't have this.
// I will stick to modifying the app to show debug info.
